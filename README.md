# Tabs: an Ionic tabs example
This simple Ionic app just demonstrates how to use tabs.

## Exercises
1. Add a different image to each tab (use your own images).
2. Add a range slider to tab one, a set of radio buttons to tab two, and a set of checkboxes to tab three.
3. Create controllers to handle each of the three tabs.
4. Use templates to display the contents of each tab.
